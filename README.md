Deadliner is an ongoing, experimental project about clocks and deadlines.

This project was an assignment from data visualization class at <a href="http://vcd.bilgi.edu.tr" target=_blank >Bilgi VCD.</a> Main goal of assignment is designing a clock without using traditional clock face. It was forbidden to use letters, numbers, clock hands and any speech voice.

I designed a <a href="http://deadliner.net/assets/img/prototype.pdf" target=_blank >prototype</a> and developed a <a href="https://omerkocaaga.github.io/barClock/" target=_blank >working version</a> for assignment.

In this version you have 1440 rectangle, which represents 1440 minutes in 1 day. Minutes grouped in 24 columns, which represents hours. If you set a deadline, you will see, how many times you have in visually. So, dark yellow color represents time you have and light color represents time you passed or couldn't use because of deadline.
